# TipsAndTricks

##Why?
I often mentor/coach more junior members of the software team so wanted use this project as a basis for presenting to graduates

Please please please along with this project read more on Design Patterns

*Code can and should be elegant*

##Why Gradle?
It's as pure and simple as me not using it before :smile: I have used Maven and Ant and thought I would try the new kid on the block

##What can be contributed?
Anything you think might help. There are a lot on Design Patterns online but what I want here is some of the *mini-design patterns* that you pick up after many hours of coding

##My Coding Mantra
Just my philosophy so you can get to know who I am and if you want to help contribute to this project
* Do **not** commit code after midday on a Friday. Review again on Monday and see what mistakes you made at the end of the week
* Keep things simple. If they are getting too complicated then divide and conquer
* Unit test everything!

##Contents
These will be added to as I transfer my notes online to this project
* How to throw more informative exceptions
* How to easily count the number of days in the year so far
